## Dossier Report Endpoint 🗂️

The `/api/v1/dossier` endpoint generates a simple, static event dossier report based on provided input. This feature is a proof of concept and does not use AI or LLMs. The report is generated using a template and basic data aggregation.

**Example usage:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/event"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/v1/dossier
```

**Note:** The dossier report is dynamic and for demonstration only.
